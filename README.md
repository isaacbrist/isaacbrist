### Hi there üëã

What are the similarities between a Doctor of Chiropractic, a stay-at-home parent, and a software engineer? All three require you to be a creative problem solver, multitasking guru, quick thinker, and mystery solver. A Chiropractor is required to hear your symptoms and discover what ails you. As a stay at home parent, it is imperative to be able to juggle conflicting, pressing demands. A software engineer must be able to take a complex problem or feature request and succinctly break that project down into actionable chunks. The best part of these similarities? I have held all of these positions, which makes me the ideal software engineer.
